## *Note:*
This app has two faces, one for students & one for faculty. If you want to test all the functionalities, then two android mobile phones with two different emails are required at the same time. One for the student & another for the faculty. After this, start location sharing with the device signed up as faculty, the other device will be automatically notified & can start tracking faculty. Chat services can also be tested.
